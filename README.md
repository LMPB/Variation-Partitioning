## Overview
In this manuscript we applied the variation partitioning on bacterial freshwater communities of 60 shallow lakes distributed across a wide area covering several river basins (over 3000 km perimeter and 250.000 km²) in Brazil. We suggest that despite the deterministic factors (mainly pH) remain paramount driving freshwater bacterial biodiversity, spatial contexts can also help to explain bacterioplankton variation resulting in high dissimilarity and elucidate how some organisms can end up dominating or being dominated in these communities. We also demonstrate the usefulness of more accurate geographic approaches to disentangle the geographic signal on microbial community composition.


## Repo content
This repo conteins all the scripts used to statistical analysis and figures showed in the manuscript, including:

* _[maps_to_GitHub.R](https://github.com/LMPB/Occupancy-Frequency-Distribution/blob/master/maps_to_GitHub.R)_: Codes used to obtain the map plot showed in the main text and supplement;
* _[b-diversity_partition.R](https://github.com/LMPB/Variation-Partitioning/blob/main/b-diversity_partition.R)_: Codes used to analyse and make figures showed in the main text;
* For the Raup-Crick analysis we applied the scripts provided by _[Chase et al. (2011) Using null models to disentangle variation in community dissimilarity from variation in α-diversity](https://doi.org/10.1890/ES10-00117.1)_ and _[Stegen et al. (2013) Quantifying community assembly processes and identifying features that impose them](https://doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2013.93)_, for presence-absence and abundance data, respsectively.
