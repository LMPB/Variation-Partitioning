## Overview
In this manuscript we applied the variation partitioning on bacterial freshwater communities of 60 shallow lakes distributed across a wide area covering several river basins (over 3000 km perimeter and 250.000 kmÂ²) in Brazil. We suggest that despite the deterministic factors (mainly pH) remain paramount driving freshwater bacterial biodiversity, spatial contexts can also help to explain bacterioplankton variation resulting in high dissimilarity and elucidate how some organisms can end up dominating or being dominated in these communities. We also demonstrate the usefulness of more accurate geographic approaches to disentangle the geographic signal on microbial community composition.
